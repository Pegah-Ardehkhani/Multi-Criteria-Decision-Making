This repository provides various algorithms and methods for Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), which is a set of approaches used to evaluate and prioritize alternatives based on multiple, often conflicting, criteria. These methods are commonly used in fields such as business, engineering, economics, healthcare, and environmental management, where decisions need to account for various factors.

## Introduction

Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is essential when faced with decisions that involve multiple criteria, some of which may conflict with each other. This repository includes implementations of several popular MCDM techniques to help users systematically evaluate and rank alternative solutions based on multiple criteria.

The methods in this repository allow you to:

- Assign weights to criteria.
- Evaluate alternatives based on different factors.
- Rank alternatives to aid in decision-making.

## Methods

This repository includes the following Multi-Criteria Decision Making methods:


1. **Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS):**

 - A method that ranks alternatives based on their distance from an ideal solution (best case) and a negative-ideal solution (worst case), aiming to find the alternative closest to the ideal and farthest from the negative-ideal.

1. **Weighted Sum Model (WSM)**
   - A linear aggregation method where alternatives are scored by summing the weighted values of each criterion.

2. **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)**
   - A method that uses pairwise comparisons and a hierarchical structure to prioritize alternatives.

3. **Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)**
   - A method that evaluates alternatives by calculating their distance from an ideal and a negative-ideal solution.

4. **Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE)**
   - A family of methods used to solve multi-criteria decision problems by eliminating inferior alternatives.

5. **PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations)**
   - A pairwise comparison method based on the preferences of decision-makers.

6. **Simple Additive Weighting (SAW)**
   - A method similar to WSM but with a focus on normalization of criteria values.

7. **VIKOR (Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje)**
   - A compromise ranking method that seeks to find the best compromise alternative.

8. **Fuzzy MCDM**
   - Adaptations of standard MCDM methods to handle uncertainty or imprecision in decision criteria.
